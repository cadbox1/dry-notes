## Graph Powered

Dry Notes looks like any other notes app but actually uses a graph data structure instead of a tree. That means a single note can exist in multiple places hence the name, [DRY (don't repeat yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). 

That means we can have calculations to do clever things like managing tasks, but that's just the beginning. 

You still write and edit notes as a tree because a tree is just one perspective of a graph. With Dry Notes you can record and explore the other perspectives of your notes.
