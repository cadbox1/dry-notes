# Dry Notes

![Tasks Demo](./tasks-demo.gif)

Dry Notes is a app for recording notes with a focus on data.

## Graph Powered

Notes looks like any other notes app but actually uses a graph data structure underneath instead of a tree. That means a single note can exist in multiple places hence the name, [DRY (don't repeat yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). 

This means we can do cool things like calculated notes to do clever things like managing tasks but that's just the beginning. 

You still write and edit notes as a tree because a tree is just one perspective of a graph. Dry Notes let's you record and explore the other perspectives.
